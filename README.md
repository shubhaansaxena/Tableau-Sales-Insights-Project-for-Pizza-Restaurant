I reached out to a local pizzeria and asked management for some sales-related data so that I could analyze it and create some dashboards for them to effectively convey any insights. I started by cleaning the Excel spreadsheets manually by removing unnecessary columns and changing column names.
Then, I loaded them on Jupyter Notebook and used Python to merge and further clean the datasets.
I wanted to use SQL to analyze the data, so I designed a star schema with a Sales Fact table and a Customer, Orders, Items, and Date dimension table.
After doing so I performed an ETL on Jupyter by creating the required tables and loading them into MySQL.
I did some exploratory data analysis using SQL and found some interesting insights for management.
I connected MySQL to Tableau and started creating some visualizations for the previously discovered insights. 
Finally, I synthesized the most important graphs and created 2 attractive dashboards.
