I reached out to a local pizzeria and asked management for some sales-related data so that I could create an attractive dashboard for them. I cleaned the Excel spreadsheets manually by removing unnecessary columns and changing column names.
Then, I loaded them on Jupyter Notebook and used Python to merge and further clean the datasets.
I wanted to use SQL to analyze the data, so I designed a star schema with a Sales Fact table and a Customer, Orders, Items, and Date dimension table.
After doing so I performed an ETL on Jupyter by creating the required tables and loading them into MySQL.
I did some exploratory data analysis on MySQL and found some interesting insights for management.
I connected MySQL to Tableau, and started creating attractive visualizations for the previously discovered insights. 
Finally, I combined the most important graphs and created 2 dashboards.
